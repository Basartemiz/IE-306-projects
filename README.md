# IE-306 Projects

This repository contains projects created for the **IE 306: Systems Simulation** course. The projects aim to apply discrete event simulation (DES) methodologies to real-life problems using **Arena/SIMAN** software.

## Course Description

This course covers the fundamental concepts of **discrete event simulation (DES)**, including:
- Simulation modeling and queueing systems
- Random number and variate generation
- Input modeling, model verification, and validation
- Statistical analysis of simulation outputs
- Applications of simulation using **Arena** software
